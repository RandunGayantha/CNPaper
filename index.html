                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>(a) Six Main Elements of a Structured Cabling System & Details for ER and TC</strong></p>
                    <p class="mb-3">A structured cabling system is a standardized architecture for telecommunications cabling in commercial buildings. The TIA/EIA-568 standard defines six main elements:</p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
                        <li><strong>Building Entrance Facilities:</strong> This is the point where the external telecommunication services (e.g., ISP connections, telephone lines) enter the building and connect to the building's internal backbone cabling. It houses the network demarcation point.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Equipment Room (ER):</strong> A centralized space that houses telecommunications equipment, such as servers, routers, switches, and PBXs. It's where incoming cabling interfaces with electronic equipment and often serves as the main cross-connect (MC) to the backbone cabling.
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a secure and environmentally controlled space for housing main networking and telecommunications equipment. It acts as a central hub for the network.</li>
                                <li class="mt-2"><strong>Key Design Considerations for Equipment Room:</strong>
                                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
                                        <li><strong>Size:</strong> Minimum 14 m² (150 ft²), with a general recommendation of 0.07 m² for every 10 m² of usable floor space.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Restricted access is crucial.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Environmental Control:</strong> Proper HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) is required, preferably a dedicated system. Temperature and EM insulation are important.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Should be carefully selected, close to backbone cables, and away from sources of interference.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Sufficient space for equipment, racks, and future expansion. Door dimensions should be adequate (e.g., &gt;90cm wide, 2m high).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Floor Loading:</strong> Must support the weight of equipment.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Grounding:</strong> Proper grounding is essential (less than 5 Ohms).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Fire Suppression:</strong> A fire suppression system should be in place.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Backbone Cabling (Vertical Cabling):</strong> Connects entrance facilities, equipment rooms, and telecommunications rooms (TRs) within a building or between buildings in a campus environment. It typically consists of high-bandwidth cables like fiber optics or high-capacity copper.</li>

                    <p class="mb-3">Given IP address block: 200.50.100.0/25</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>i. Subnet mask in dotted decimal notation for /25:</strong><br>
                    A /25 mask means the first 25 bits are network bits (set to 1) and the remaining (32 - 25 = 7) bits are host bits (set to 0).<br>
                    In binary: <code>11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000</code><br>
                    Converting each octet to decimal:<br>
                    <code>11111111</code> = 255<br>
                    <code>11111111</code> = 255<br>
                    <code>11111111</code> = 255<br>
                    <code>10000000</code> = 128<br>
                    So, the subnet mask is <strong>255.255.255.128</strong>.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>ii. Number of subnets if further subnetted using a /28 mask:</strong><br>

                    Number of bits borrowed for subnetting = New mask bits - Original mask bits = 28 - 25 = 3 bits.<br>

                    The original block is 200.50.100.0/25. The last octet is 0 in binary <code>00000000</code>. The /25 mask means the network part of the last octet is the first bit.<br>
                    The network is 200.50.100.0. The host range for this /25 network is 200.50.100.1 to 200.50.100.126, with broadcast 200.50.100.127.</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-3 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Step 1 (SYN):</strong> The client wants to establish a connection with the server. It sends a segment with the SYN (Synchronize Sequence Numbers) flag set, along with its own initial sequence number (ISN), say <code>x</code>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 2 (SYN-ACK):</strong> The server, upon receiving the SYN segment, responds with a segment that has both SYN and ACK flags set. It acknowledges the client's ISN by setting the acknowledgment number to <code>x+1</code>. The server also chooses its own ISN, say <code>y</code>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 3 (ACK):</strong> The client receives the server's SYN-ACK segment. It sends an acknowledgment segment back to the server. This segment has the ACK flag set, and the acknowledgment number is set to <code>y+1</code> (acknowledging the server's ISN).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once these three steps are completed, the TCP connection is established, and data transfer can begin.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>(c) Role of Port Numbers and Categories</strong></p>
                    <p class="mb-3">At the Transport Layer, <strong>port numbers</strong> are used to identify specific application processes running on a host. When data arrives at a host, the port number in the segment header tells the operating system which application process should receive the data. This allows multiple applications on a host to use the network simultaneously (demultiplexing).</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has divided the 16-bit port number space (0-65535) into three categories:</p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3">
                        <li><strong>Well-Known Ports (0 to 1023):</strong>

                                <li>These are reserved for common services and applications provided by server processes.</li>
                                <li>Client applications use these port numbers to request services from servers that are listening on these specific ports.</li>
                                <li>Examples:
                                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-1 space-y-1">

                                        <li><strong>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):</strong> Port 25</li>

                    <p class="mb-3">The Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain model describes the typical stages an adversary goes through to execute an attack. Understanding these stages helps defenders to identify and mitigate threats.</p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
                        <li><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The attacker gathers information about the target. This can include identifying target systems, network infrastructure, employee information, vulnerabilities, and security policies.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> An attacker uses tools like Nmap to scan the target organization's IP address range for open ports and services, or searches social media like LinkedIn for employee names and email address formats.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Weaponization:</strong>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The attacker creates a deliverable malicious payload by combining an exploit (to take advantage of a vulnerability) with a backdoor or other malware.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> An attacker crafts a Microsoft Word document with a malicious macro (the payload) that exploits a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office (the exploit).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Delivery:</strong>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The attacker transmits the weaponized payload to the target environment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The attacker sends the malicious Word document created in the weaponization stage as an attachment in a spear-phishing email to an employee of the target organization. Other methods include infected USB drives or compromised websites.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The malicious payload is triggered, exploiting a vulnerability on the target system to gain initial access or execute code.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The employee opens the malicious Word document, enabling macros, which then run the exploit code, allowing the attacker's malware to execute on the employee's computer.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The attacker installs malware or other tools on the compromised system to establish persistence and maintain access for future operations. This could involve installing a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), backdoor, or rootkit.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The malware executed during the exploitation stage downloads and installs a RAT on the victim's computer, configuring it to start automatically when the computer boots.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The installed malware establishes an outbound communication channel to a server controlled by the attacker, allowing the attacker to remotely control the compromised system, send commands, and exfiltrate data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The RAT on the compromised computer connects to the attacker's C2 server over the internet, waiting for instructions or sending system information.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The attacker performs actions to achieve their ultimate goals. This could include data theft (exfiltration), data destruction, system disruption, ransomware deployment, or using the compromised system as a launchpad for further attacks.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The attacker uses the C2 channel to navigate the target network, locate sensitive financial documents, and upload them to their own server. Alternatively, they might deploy ransomware to encrypt files and demand payment.</li>

                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>(b) Importance of Understanding the Cyber Kill Chain and Defensive Actions</strong></p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Understanding the Cyber Kill Chain is crucial for network defense because it provides a framework to:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li>Analyze attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).</li>
                        <li>Identify potential points of intervention to disrupt or block an attack at various stages.</li>
                        <li>Develop and implement a layered security approach, with controls at each stage.</li>
                        <li>Improve incident response by understanding how far an attacker has progressed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Defensive Actions:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
                        <li><strong>Delivery Stage:</strong>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Potential Defensive Action:</strong> Implement robust <strong>email security gateways</strong> with advanced threat protection features. These can scan email attachments and links for known malware, phishing indicators, and malicious content, blocking or quarantining suspicious emails before they reach the user. User awareness training on identifying phishing emails is also key.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Installation Stage:</strong>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Potential Defensive Action:</strong> Employ <strong>endpoint detection and response (EDR)</strong> solutions or host-based intrusion prevention systems (HIPS). These tools can monitor endpoint behavior for suspicious activities indicative of malware installation (e.g., unauthorized registry changes, creation of new services, unexpected file drops) and can block these actions or alert security personnel. Application whitelisting can also prevent unauthorized software from running.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>(c) Firewall vs. IDS</strong></p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Firewall:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Primary Function:</strong> A network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules (e.g., ACLs based on IP addresses, ports, protocols).</li>
                        <li><strong>Operation:</strong> Acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet). Its main goal is to <em>prevent</em> unauthorized access by filtering traffic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Analogy:</strong> A security guard at a gate who checks IDs and allows or denies entry based on a list.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Intrusion Detection System (IDS):</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Primary Function:</strong> A device or software application that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations and produces reports to a management station.</li>
                        <li><strong>Operation:</strong> An IDS <em>detects</em> potential intrusions or attacks, often by analyzing network traffic for known attack signatures or anomalous behavior. It primarily <em>alerts</em> administrators rather than actively blocking traffic (though an IPS, Intrusion Prevention System, can take action).</li>
                        <li><strong>Analogy:</strong> A surveillance camera system with an alarm that notifies security if something suspicious is detected.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Firewalls primarily <em>prevent</em> by blocking traffic based on rules. IDSs primarily <em>detect</em> and alert.</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Firewalls focus on controlling access based on predefined rules (ports, IPs). IDSs focus on identifying malicious patterns or anomalies within allowed traffic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Firewalls are typically placed at network perimeters. IDSs can be network-based (NIDS) or host-based (HIDS) and can monitor traffic within the network or on individual hosts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-3">An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) combines the detection capabilities of an IDS with the ability to actively block or prevent detected threats, making it more similar to a firewall in its ability to take action, but with a focus on threat signatures and behavior rather than just static rules.</p>
